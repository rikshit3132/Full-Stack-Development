Let’s understand Client–Server Architecture in both cases:
1. Traditional Server-Side Routing
2. React (Client-Side Routing / SPA)

### Traditional Server-Side Architecture
Example: Wikipedia
-> How It Works (Step-by-Step)
Step 1:-
User types:
-> example.com/about
Step 2:-
-> Browser sends HTTP request to server.
Step 3:-
Server:
-> Processes request
-> Talks to database
-> Generates full HTML page

Step 4:-
-> Server sends complete HTML document.
Step 5:-
Browser:
-> Destroys old page
-> Loads new HTML
-> Re-renders everything

### What Happens on Every Navigation?

Every click:
-> New request
-> New HTML
-> Full page reload
-> JS restarts
-> State resets

 Architecture Flow
Browser  →  Server  →  Database
   ↑           ↓
 Full HTML  Response
 Advantages :-
-> Good for SEO (search engines love full HTML)
-> Simpler logic
-> Works without JavaScript

Disadvantages:-
-> Slower
-> Full reload every time
-> State lost on navigation

 React SPA (Client-Side Routing)
Example: Facebook
 How It Works (Step-by-Step)
First Load Only:
Browser requests website
Server sends:
One HTML file
JS bundle
CSS
React loads in browser
After that 
When You Navigate
If you go to:
/profile
Browser DOES NOT request new HTML.
Instead:
React Router detects URL change
React swaps components
UI updates instantly

 Architecture Flow
Initial:
Browser → Server → index.html + JS

After Load:
Browser (React handles everything)

API Calls:
Browser → Server → JSON data
🔥 Important Difference

In SPA:

Server sends DATA (JSON)
Client builds UI

In Traditional:

Server sends FULL UI (HTML)

🟣 Real Comparison
Feature	Server-Side	React SPA
HTML generated	Server	Client
Navigation	Full reload	No reload
State preserved	❌	✅
Data transfer	HTML pages	JSON data
Speed after first load	Slow	Very fast
🔎 What Actually Changes?
Traditional:

Server controls everything.

React SPA:

Server becomes mostly an API provider.

🧠 Big Picture

Traditional Architecture:

Server = Brain
Browser = Viewer

React SPA:

Browser = Brain
Server = Data Provider
