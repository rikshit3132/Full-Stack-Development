===== What is React Router?====
-->> React Router is a library that allows 
navigation between components without reloading 
the page.

-->> In normal websites:
-->> When you click a link → page reloads
In React:
-->> We want Single Page Application (SPA)
-->> Only the component changes
-->> Page does NOT reload


=======What is <BrowserRouter>?===

-->> Think of BrowserRouter as the manager of routing
system.
It:

-->> Watches URL changes
-->> Decides which component to show
-->> Uses browser history API
->> Where to put it?
-->> Usually in main.jsx or index.js
Example:

import { BrowserRouter } from "react-router-dom";
ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")).render(
  <BrowserRouter>
    <App />
  </BrowserRouter>
);

 -->> Wrap your entire app with it
 -->> You use it ONLY ONCE

========What is <Routes> and <Route>?========
1) <Routes>
-->> It is a container.
-->> It looks at current URL and checks which 
->> Route matches.

2) <Route>

It defines:
-->> path
-->> which component to show
Example:
<Routes>
  <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
  <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
  <Route path="/contact" element={<Contact />} />
</Routes>

======== What is <Link>? ======

-->> Link is used for navigation.

->> Wrong way (reloads page):
<a href="/about">About</a>

-->> Correct way:
<Link to="/about">About</Link>
-->> It changes URL without refreshing page.


Full Flow (Very Important 🚀)

Let’s say you open:

http://localhost:5173/about
Step 1:

BrowserRouter sees URL is /about

Step 2:

It goes inside <Routes>

Step 3:

It checks all <Route> paths

Step 4:

It finds:

path="/about"
Step 5:

It renders:

<About />

Navbar stays because it is outside Routes.


WHY Navbar Outside Routes?

Because:

<Navbar />
<Routes>...</Routes>

Means:

Navbar → always visible
Routes → changes based on URL

If you put Navbar inside Route:

<Route path="/" element={<Navbar />} />

Then it will only show on /
