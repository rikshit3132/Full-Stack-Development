What is Reconciliation?

Reconciliation is the process by which React updates 
the UI when state or props change.

In simple words:
When something changes →
React must decide:
What changed?
What stayed same?
What to update in the real DOM?
That entire decision-making process is called Reconciliation.

What is Diffing?

Diffing is a part of Reconciliation.
Definition:
Diffing is the algorithm React uses to compare 
the old Virtual DOM with the new Virtual DOM 
to find differences.
React does NOT compare real DOMs.
It compares:
Old Virtual DOM
vs
New Virtual DOM
That comparison process = Diffing.

#### Full Flow of What Happens

Let’s say you use useState:
setCount(count + 1);

Now internally:
Step 1: State Update
React marks component for re-render.

Step 2: Re-render
The component function runs again.

Step 3: New Virtual DOM is created
Now we have:
Previous Virtual DOM
New Virtual DOM

Step 4: Diffing
React compares both trees.

Step 5: Reconciliation
React updates ONLY the changed parts in the real DOM.



### Important: How React Diffing Works Efficiently
If React compared everything deeply, it would be slow.
So React makes 2 important assumptions:
Rule 1️⃣: Different Element Types → Replace Entire Tree
Example:
<div>
   <h1>Hello</h1>
</div>
Becomes:
<span>
   <h1>Hello</h1>
</span>
Since div ≠ span, React destroys old tree and builds new one.

Rule 2️⃣: Same Type → Update Only Changed Attributes
Example:
<h1 className="red">Hello</h1>
Becomes:
<h1 className="blue">Hello</h1>
React:
Keeps <h1>
Only updates class
Efficient ✅
🔑 Special Case: Lists and Keys
Example:
{items.map(item => <li>{item}</li>)}
Without key, React cannot properly track elements.
With:
{items.map(item => <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>)}
Now React can:
Track movement
Avoid unnecessary re-renders
Keys are critical for correct diffing.


What Is Virtual DOM?

Virtual DOM is:

A lightweight JavaScript object

Representation of the real DOM

Stored in memory

React never directly manipulates DOM immediately.
It calculates changes first.

🔬 What Makes React Fast?
React does NOT optimize DOM.
It optimizes:
DOM calculations
DOM updates
Unnecessary re-renders
Diffing complexity is:
O(n)
Instead of:
O(n³) (naive tree comparison)
That’s a massive improvement.

Final Clear Difference
Term	                    Meaning
Diffing	            Comparing old and new Virtual DOM
Reconciliation	    Full process of updating the UI
Virtual DOM	        Lightweight copy of real DOM
Fiber	            Internal engine handling reconciliation

Reconciliation is the process React uses to 
update the DOM efficiently when state or props 
change. During reconciliation, React performs 
diffing — an optimized comparison between the 
previous and current virtual DOM trees — and 
updates only the necessary parts of the real DOM.
