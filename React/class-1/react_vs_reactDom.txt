### React
-> The core React library. 
-> It gives you the brain of React.

## What it does:
-> Create components
-> Use JSX
-> Manage state & props
-> Use Hooks (useState, useEffect, etc.)
-> Define what the UI should look like

### What it does NOT do:
-> It does not touch the browser DOM
-> It does not know where your UI will be rendered

## Example:
import React from "react";
function App() {
  return <h1>Hello React</h1>;
}
export default App;
-> Here, React only describes the UI.

### ReactDOM library (react-dom)
-> What it is:
-->> The bridge between React and the browser DOM.
#### What it does:
-> Takes React components
-> Renders them into the real HTML DOM
-> Updates the DOM efficiently using Virtual DOM

## Main job:
-> Attach React to the browser

### Example:

import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import App from "./App";
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(
  document.getElementById("root")
);
root.render(<App />);

-->> This line is key:
root.render(<App />);
-->>  ReactDOM puts your React app inside
-->> <div id="root"></div> in index.html.

### React and ReactDOM
-->> React is used to create UI components and manage 
-->> state, while ReactDOM is responsible for 
-->> rendering those components into the browser’s DOM.
