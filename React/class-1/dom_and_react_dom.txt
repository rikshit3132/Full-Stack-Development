### DOM 
DOM (Document Object Model) is a tree representation 
of HTML created by the browser.
for example:-
<div id="root">
  <h1>Hello</h1>
</div>

Browser creates this DOM tree:

Document
 └── html
     └── body
         └── div#root
             └── h1

Key points:
DOM is real
Stored in browser memory
Changing DOM = expensive
Every change triggers reflow & repaint

How DOM works (Vanilla JS)
const h1 = document.getElementById("title");
h1.innerText = "Hello React";

What happens internally?

-> Browser finds the node
-> Updates DOM
-> Recalculates layout
-> Repaints screen
--> Repeating this many times → slow apps

Problems with DOM
-> Direct manipulation is slow
-> Code becomes complex
-> Hard to maintain large UIs
-> Manual DOM updates = bugs
-->>This is where React comes in.

### What is React DOM?

-> React DOM is a library that:
-> Connects React with the browser DOM
-> Efficiently updates the real DOM
-> Uses Virtual DOM

import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";


### What is Virtual DOM? (CORE IDEA)

Virtual DOM is:
-> Lightweight JavaScript object
-> Copy of real DOM
-> Stored in memory

Example:

{
  type: "h1",
  props: { children: "Hello" }
}
->> React never updates the real DOM directly.

### How React DOM works (Step-by-Step)

When state changes:
->  React creates a new Virtual DOM
->  Compares with previous Virtual DOM (diffing)
->  Finds minimal changes (reconciliation)
->  React DOM updates only changed nodes
 -> Fast
 -> Efficient
 -> Optimized
