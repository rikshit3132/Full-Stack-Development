### Async tasks are not saved in Web APIs.
Web APIs execute and manage async operations, 
and once completed, their callbacks are placed into
the task queue or microtask queue, from where 
the event loop sends them back to the call stack.

libuv in ONE LINE (memorize this)

libuv is the system that allows Node.js to do async work (like file, network, timers) without blocking JavaScript.

That’s it.
Now let’s expand.

 Why libuv is even needed?
Fact 1: JavaScript is single-threaded 
It can do only one thing at a time.

Fact 2: Real-world tasks are slow 

Examples:
Reading a file
Talking to a database
Network request
Timer
If JS did these directly:
JS waits → program freezes 
libuv exists to prevent this freezing.

3️⃣ Think of libuv as a “manager” 
Imagine this:
JavaScript = CEO
libuv = Operations Manager
OS / Threads = Workers
CEO (JS): "Read this file"
Manager (libuv): "Okay, I’ll handle it"
CEO (JS): keeps doing other work
JS does not wait.
 What exactly does libuv do?
libuv does 4 main jobs:
 1. Event Loop
Controls when callbacks run
 2. Thread Pool
Runs blocking tasks in background threads
 3. OS Interaction
Talks to your operating system
 4. Async Abstraction

Hides OS complexity from JS
 Simple example (fs.readFile)
const fs = require("fs");
console.log("A");
fs.readFile("file.txt", () => {
  console.log("B");
});
console.log("C");
What you think happens 
A → read file → B → C
What actually happens 
A
C
B
WHY?
Because:
 JS sends readFile to libuv
 libuv uses thread pool
 JS continues
 When done → callback queued
 Event loop runs it later
 Where libuv “lives” 
Important to understand:
Thing	                Where
JavaScript	            V8 engine
Node.js APIs	        JavaScript layer
libuv	                C library
OS threads	            Operating system

JS → Node APIs → libuv → OS
JS never talks to OS directly.
