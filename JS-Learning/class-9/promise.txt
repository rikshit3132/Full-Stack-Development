### why Promises even exist (very important)
-> JavaScript is single-threaded.
That means:
-> JS can do only ONE thing at a time
-> If a long task blocks JS → the whole page freezes 
 So JS uses asynchronous operations:
-> Fetch data from server
-> Read file
-> setTimeout
-> Database calls
#### Problem without Promise
let data = getDataFromServer(); //  this takes time
console.log(data);             // JS doesn't wait
JS does not wait for the result.

Note:- “Hey JS, this work will finish later.
When it finishes, THEN do something.”
-> That “something later” container is a Promise.

### what is promise ?
-> A Promise is an object that represents a value that 
will be available in the future.
-> Not now.
-> Not immediately.
-> But later.

### Real-life analogy (very important)

-> You order food on Zomato.
-> They give you a receipt.
That receipt is a Promise.
--> Food not ready 
--> Food will come later 
You can:
---> eat if delivered
---> complain if cancelled
-> Promise = Receipt of future result

#### Promise has ONLY 3 states
-> A promise is always in one of these:
PENDING   → initial state
FULFILLED → operation successful
REJECTED  → operation failed
-> From pending state the promise 
-> either go in FULFILLED state
-> or go in REJECTED state.Not comes back,terminated.
-> Once fulfilled or rejected → state never changes again.

#### Creating a Promise
const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    // some async work
});

## (resolve, reject)
-> resolve(value) → success
-> reject(error) → failure


Example -1:-
const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
     console.log("Iam inside promise!!!");
});
It Immediately fulfilled.

Example 2: Promise with delay
const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
        resolve("Data received");
    }, 2000);
});

Promise created → pending
After 2 seconds → fulfilled

### Using a Promise (THIS is where confusion starts)
**** You do NOT get value directly
 This will NOT work:
const result = myPromise;
console.log(result); // Promise object, not data
Because the value is future value.

##### How to get value from Promise → .then()
myPromise.then((data) => {
    console.log(data);
});

*** Meaning of .then()
“WHEN the promise is fulfilled, THEN run this function”

##### Handling failure → .catch()
const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    reject("Something went wrong");
});
promise
  .then((data) => {
      console.log(data);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
      console.log(error);
  });
Note:- .catch() runs only if promise is rejected.
