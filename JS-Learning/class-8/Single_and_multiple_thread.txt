Single-Threaded 

-> Only ONE call stack
-> One task at a time
Task A → Task B → Task C

Multi-Threaded

-> Multiple call stacks
-> Tasks run in parallel
Thread 1: Task A
Thread 2: Task B
Thread 3: Task C

So Why NOT Make JS Multi-Threaded?
-> This is the KEY QUESTION
-> Because JavaScript was designed to work 
with the DOM safely and simply.

DOM is NOT Thread-Safe (MAIN REASON)
-> What is DOM?
-> Shared memory structure
-> Represents webpage UI
-> Imagine Multi-Threaded JS 
-> Thread 1 → Change button text
-> Thread 2 → Remove button
-> Race conditions
-> Data corruption
-> Browser crashes

Example Problem
// Thread 1
button.textContent = "Click";
// Thread 2
button.remove();
Which runs first?
What if both run at same time?
