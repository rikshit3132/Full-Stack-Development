--> libuv is a C library that makes asynchronous 
--> I/O possible in Node.js

-->> Node.js itself is written in:
C++
Uses V8 (JavaScript engine)
Uses libuv for async operations

-->> Why Do We Need libuv?
JavaScript is:
Single-threaded
Has only 1 Call Stack
But Node.js can:
Read files
Make network requests
Handle 1000s of users
Run timers

-->> This is only possible because of libuv.

-->> What libuv Provides
1️⃣ Event Loop
Controls async execution cycle.

2️⃣ Thread Pool
Default size = 4 threads
Used for:
fs (file system)
crypto
dns
compression

3️⃣ Non-blocking Networking
Sockets
HTTP
TCP
UDP

### How libuv Works (Step by Step)
Example:
const fs = require("fs");
fs.readFile("data.txt", "utf8", (err, data) => {
  console.log(data);
});
console.log("Done");
🟢 Step 1
JS executes fs.readFile
It does NOT read file directly.
It goes:
JS → V8 → Node C++ → libuv

🟢 Step 2

libuv sends file reading task to:
👉 Thread Pool
Because file system is blocking at OS level.
So:
Thread Pool (background)
   |
   |-- Reads file
Meanwhile...
JS Call Stack continues.

🟢 Step 3
console.log("Done") runs immediately.
Output:
Done

🟢 Step 4
When thread finishes reading file:
Callback goes to Event Loop
Event Loop pushes it to Call Stack
Callback executes
Output:
Done
<file content>
