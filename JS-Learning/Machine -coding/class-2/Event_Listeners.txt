###what is Event?
-> An event is something that happens in the browser.
Examples:
-> User clicks a button
-> User types a key
-> Page finishes loading
-> Mouse moves
-> Form is submitted

### What is an Event Listener?
An event listener is a function that waits 
for an event to happen and then executes code.
-> "If this event happens → run this function".
-> Event listeners are functions attached to DOM 
elements using addEventListener() that listen for 
user or browser events and execute code, supporting 
bubbling,capturing, delegation, and removal.

### 3 types of defining events listeners

 1) inline html event Handlers
<button onclick="sayHello()">Click</button>

<script>
function sayHello() {
  alert("Hello");
}
</script>

Problems:-
-> Mixes HTML + JS
-> Hard to maintain
-> Only ONE handler allowed
-> Not used in modern apps

2) DOM Property Handler
const btn = document.querySelector("button");

btn.onclick = function () {
  console.log("Clicked");
};

Problems:-
-> Only one event handler
-> New one overrides old one
Example:-
btn.onclick = () => console.log("First");
btn.onclick = () => console.log("Second"); // overrides

3)addEventListener()(BEST & MODERN)
btn.addEventListener("click", function () {
  console.log("Clicked");
});

Advantages:-
-> Multiple listeners allowed
-> Supports bubbling & capturing
-> Can remove listeners
-> Clean & professional

#### addEventListener() Syntax (IMPORTANT)
-> element.addEventListener(eventType, handler, options);
-> eventType → "click", "keydown", etc.
-> handler → function to execute
-> options → capture, once, passive (optional)

### Event Object (event or e)
-> Every event handler automatically receives an event object.
btn.addEventListener("click", function (event) {
  console.log(event);
});

### Common Properties:
-> event.target      // element that triggered event
-> event.currentTarget // element listener attached to
-> event.type        // click, keydown, etc.
-> event.preventDefault()
-> event.stopPropagation()

### Types of Event Listeners (Events)
1) Mouse Events
-> click, dblclick
-> mousedown, mouseup
-> mousemove
-> mouseenter / mouseleave (no bubbling)
-> mouseover / mouseout (bubbles)

2) Keyboard Events
-> keydown
-> keyup
-> keypress (deprecated-> not used -> older)

3) Form Events
-> submit
-> input (real-time)
-> change (after blur)
-> focus
-> blur

4) Window / Document Events
-> DOMContentLoaded
-> load
-> scroll
-> resize
-> beforeunload

###  e.stopImmediatePropagation();

-> stopImmediatePropagation() is a DOM Event method used
to completely stop an event at the current element
itself.It is stronger than stopPropagation().

It does THREE things at once:
-> Stops the event from moving to parent elements 
(no bubbling / capturing).
-> Stops other event listeners on the SAME element.
-> Prevents further execution of listeners added after it.

### Bubbling Effect
target ->>>> top

### Capturing Effect
top ->>>> target

#### e.stopPropagation()
-> Stops bubbling or capturing.

#### Removing Event Listeners (IMPORTANT)
-> This DOES NOT work
btn.removeEventListener("click", function () {});

-> Correct Way
function handleClick() {
  console.log("Clicked");
}

btn.addEventListener("click", handleClick);
btn.removeEventListener("click", handleClick);
Note:-
-> Same function reference is mandatory

#### Event Options (Advanced)
btn.addEventListener("click", handler, {
  once: true,
  capture: false,
  passive: true
});

-> Options Explained:
once → runs only once
capture → capturing phase
passive → better scroll performance
